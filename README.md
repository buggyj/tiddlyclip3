# tiddlyclip3 is [tiddlyclip](https://github.com/buggyj/tiddlyclip) reconstructed for the new chrome V3 extension interface.
## note that this is a pre-release and has not been full tested - use at your own risk!

Getting started (chrome)

Install the addon by downloading (click this link to download [link to zip](https://github.com/buggyj/tiddlyclip3/archive/refs/tags/v0.0.2-pre.zip)) and unzipping (e.g. in a directory called tiddlyclip). Then in chrome navigate to chrome://extensions/ and click 'load unpacked extension' and go the tiddlyclip/extension/ directory to select the extension (it's the directory containing the 'manifest.json' file).

Note that chome will ask you to disable the 'developer mode' extensions each time you start the browser (but not with linux), as the extension was not loaded from the Chrome Web Store.
